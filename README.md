A year ago, I began trading seriously while balancing my academic studies. Academic commitments often constrained me, as morning classes made it difficult to trade consistently.Six months ago, I transitioned to trading full time. I found that even without academic distractions, my progress in trading was limited. I was still far from being able to make a living from it, while real-world financial pressures continued to exist.I previously believed that quantitative trading was an overly expensive dream for retail traders. However, I now hope to understand the entire process and attempt to build a trading system. At the very least, it should help me with analytical tasks, and perhaps even help me secure a job.
